# JavaScript Objects, Scopes, Closures

This repository contains solutions to various JavaScript tasks related to objects, scopes, and closures. Each task is implemented as a separate JavaScript file and can be run individually.

## Project Structure

- **Directories:** Each task has its own directory within the project.
- **Files:** JavaScript files for each task contain the implementation.
- **Tests:** You can find sample test files (`main.js`) provided along with each task to demonstrate how to use the implemented classes or functions.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:


2. Navigate to the specific task directory you are interested in.

3. Run the JavaScript file using Node.js:


Replace `main.js` with the appropriate test file provided for each task.

## Task List

Below is the list of tasks available in this repository:

- **Rectangle Classes:** Includes tasks related to defining rectangles and squares using classes in JavaScript.
- **Occurrences:** A function to find the number of occurrences of a given element in a list.
- **Esrever:** A function to reverse a list without using the built-in `reverse` method.
- **Log Me:** A function to log the number of arguments already printed and the new argument value.
- **Number Conversion:** A function to convert a number from base 10 to another base.
- **Factor Index:** A script that computes a new array from the given array.
- **Sorted Occurrences:** A script that sorts occurrences by user ID.
- **Concat Files:** A script to concatenate two files.

Each task directory contains detailed instructions on how to use the provided JavaScript files.
